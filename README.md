## About me

I am a detail-oriented and solution-driven individual with a unique blend of technical expertise and strong interpersonal skills. My foundation in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, combined with hands-on experience in both manual and automation testing, allows me to approach problems with analytical precision and user-centric thinking.

I hold a Master’s degree from Sheffield Hallam University and have professional experience in diverse testing environments, including web, mobile, and API testing. My previous roles have strengthened my ability to design robust test cases, implement scalable automation frameworks, and ensure software quality across functional and non-functional dimensions.

Currently, I am further refining my skills in areas like performance testing, security validation, and CI/CD integration by engaging in real-world projects and continuous learning. I take pride in identifying critical defects early in the lifecycle and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver stable, high-performing applications.

I am now eager to apply my accumulated knowledge and passion for quality assurance in a dynamic team setting. My goal is to grow into a lead-level QA role, driving both innovation and efficiency in software testing over the next few years

## 🧠QAPhilosophy

> I believe quality is not just about finding bugs — it's about preventing them. My approach focuses on **shift-left testing**, deep collaboration with developers, and **test automation as a core part of the development process**, not an afterthought. I strive to blend **business understanding with technical skills**, ensuring that each release is stable, secure, and user-centric.

## 🚧Real-WorldProblemsISolved

* **Cut regression time by 60%** by implementing parallel test execution in Jenkins pipelines using Selenium Grid.
* **Eliminated repetitive manual testing** by building a scalable API test suite with RestAssured, reducing release cycle stress.
* **Identified security flaws** in client APIs using OWASP ZAP, preventing potential data leaks and strengthening compliance.
* **Improved test reliability** by implementing retry mechanisms and dynamic waits in flaky UI tests.
* **Enabled early defect detection** by integrating test automation into pull request pipelines on GitHub Actions.


## 📁SampleProjects 

## 🔹 Selenium-Cucumber Framework (Java)

> BDD-aligned test automation suite for an e-commerce application. Integrated with Jenkins CI, Allure Reports, and Page Object Model for clean scalability.

#### 🔹 API Automation – RestAssured & Postman

> Comprehensive REST API test suite validating 200+ endpoints. Includes environment configs, JSON schema validations, and dynamic data injection.

#### 🔹 Cypress Frontend Tests

> Web UI automation suite for a modern React app. Includes modular test structure, custom commands, and visual regression proofing.

#### 🔹 Performance Test with JMeter

> Load test scripts for high-traffic REST APIs, simulating up to 1,000 concurrent users. Includes results analysis and tuning suggestions.

## 🏆WhatSetsMeApart

* I **speak both developer and tester** — making me effective in Agile teams
* I treat **test automation like software development**, with maintainable and scalable code
* I combine **manual exploratory insight** with **automation efficiency**
* I always consider **performance, security, and accessibility** as part of quality
* I bring **a global perspective**, having worked with teams in the UK, India, and remotely across time zones

## 📖Blog / Knowledge Sharing 

* "Designing Reliable Selenium Frameworks in Java"
* "Getting Started with API Testing: Postman vs RestAssured"
* "How I Integrated Cypress Tests into GitHub Actions"
* "Exploratory Testing: Going Beyond the Test Case"

## 🔍TestStrategyHighlights

> Every project demands a custom approach. I focus on designing **risk-based, scalable, and maintainable testing strategies** that align with both business goals and tech constraints.

* **Risk-Based Testing**: Prioritized critical user flows and high-impact areas to ensure max coverage with minimal test overhead.
* **Data-Driven Testing**: Used Excel/CSV-based datasets and parameterized scripts to validate edge cases and boundary conditions.
* **Hybrid Automation Strategy**: Combined **UI + API** automation to catch backend issues early and validate UI consistency.

## 📊MetricsThatMatter

*Real QA value lies in measurable outcomes. Here are a few metrics I've influenced in past roles:

| Metric                      | Before     | After    | Impact                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| Regression test execution   | 3 days     | 1 day    | Reduced by 60% via automation     |
| Defect leakage post-release | \~12/month | <3/month | Improved quality by 75%           |
| Manual effort in UAT        | High       | Low      | Offloaded 70% to automated tests  |
| Bug reproducibility rate    | \~50%      | 95%+     | Improved through detailed reports |

## 🔧ToolsinAction–RealUseCases

**Jira**

> Defined test cycles, managed defect life cycles, and reported QA KPIs to stakeholders weekly.
> **Allure Reports**
> Integrated Allure with CI pipelines for detailed visual reports with screenshots and test steps.
> **BrowserStack**
> Used for cross-browser testing across Chrome, Safari, and mobile devices—automated regression on real devices.
> **Docker + Jenkins**
> Built containerized test environments to simulate microservices and ensure stable integration testing.
